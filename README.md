## About
- A game that you control a ship and move across a path of planets to an end goal. At each stop an event will happen that will tell you what happens or present you with a choice to make. The events will be generated randomly with differing outcomes being weighted differently. The ships stats will be affected by events. The goal is to reach the final frontier.
